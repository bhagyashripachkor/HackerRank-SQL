Consider P1(a,b)P1(a,b) and P2(c,d)P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b)(a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d)(c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1P1 and P2P2 and round it to 44 decimal digits.

SELECT ROUND(abs((MAX(LONG_W) - MAX(LAT_N)))+ABS((MIN(LAT_N)-MIN(LONG_W))),4) FROM STATION;
